# 🤖 PyTutor – Python Learning Chatbot

This project is part of my CodTech internship in the Python Programming domain. It demonstrates the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in building an intelligent chatbot that assists users in learning Python fundamentals. The chatbot, named **PyTutor**, interacts through text input and provides clear explanations of basic programming topics such as variables, loops, functions, and object-oriented programming. It also handles small talk, greetings, and general help queries, making the learning experience engaging and interactive.

The chatbot is built using Python’s **NLTK** library for text processing, tokenization, and stopword filtering. It applies simple NLP logic to detect keywords from user input and respond contextually using a predefined knowledge base. Designed for use in Google Colab or any Python IDE, PyTutor offers a practical demonstration of combining rule-based logic with natural language understanding to create an educational conversational agent.
